{} (code) --> Memory Creation phase / Creation phase
          --> Execution phase

                                    Example code:
    1. Global Execution 
            |
           this

    2. Memory phase

        val1 --> undefined
        val2 --> undefined
        addNum --> definition
        result1 --> undefined
        result2 --> undefined

    3. Execution phase

        val1 <-- 10
        val2 <-- 5
        addNum -->  new variable environment 
                            +
                         Execution thread






                                    let val1=10;
                                    let val2=5;
                                    function addNum(num1,num2){
                                        let total = num1+num2;
                                        return total;
                                    }

                                    let result1 = addNum(val1, val2);
                                    let result2 = addNum(10,2);
